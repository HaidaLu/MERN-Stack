- Create a single redux store that manages the state of your entire app
- Your react components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role.
- You dispatch actions directly from React components -> then trigger store updates.

> Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, you need to use the `react-redux` package. -> It provides a way for you to pass Redux `state` and `dispatch` to your React components as props.



1. Create a simple React component -> input new text messages. 

   These are added to an array that's displayed in the view.

2. You'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array.

3. use `react-redux` to connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.



### Use Provider to Connect Redux to React

> To provide React access to the Redux store and the actions it needs to dispatch updates.

React Redux provides a small API with 2 key features: `Provider` and `connect`. 



#### Provider

> The provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app.
>
> -> allows you to access the **Redux `store` and `dispatch` functions** throughout your component tree.

`Provider` takes two props: the Redux store and the child components of your app.

```react
<Provider store = {store}>
  <App/>
</Provider>
```

```react
// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return [
        ...state,
        action.message
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};



const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:

class DisplayMessages extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  submitMessage() {  
    this.setState((state) => {
      const currentMessage = state.input;
      return {
        input: '',
        messages: state.messages.concat(currentMessage)
      };
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                 <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  // Render the Provider below this line
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <DisplayMessages/>
      </Provider>
    )
  }

  // Change code above this line
};
```



#### connect  

##### Map State to Props

The provider component allows you to provide `state` and `dispatch` to your react components

-> must specify exactly what state and actions you want.

-> make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs.

->**Creating two functions : `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`**



In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch. 

**Note:** Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the `store.subscribe()` method to implement `mapStateToProps()`.

```react
const state = [];

// change code below this line
const mapStateToProps = (state)=>{
  return {
    messages: state
  }
}
```



##### Map Dispatch to Props

> The `mapDispatchToProps()` function is to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store.

It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component `props`. 

However, instead of returning a piece of `state`, each property returns a function that calls `dispatch` with an action creator and any relevant action data.

e.g. you have a `loginUser()` action creator that takes a `username` as an action payload. The object returned from `mapDispatchToProps()` for this action creator would look something like

```react
{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}
```

```react
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

// change code below this line
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
    return {
        submitNewMessage: (message)=>{
            dispatch(addMessage(message))
        }
    }
}
```



#### Connect Redux to React

> Now that you've written both the `mapStateToProps()` and the `mapDispatchToProps()` functions, you can use them to map `state` and `dispatch` to the `props` of one of your React components. The `connect` method from React Redux can handle this task. 

connect takes two optional arguments, `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`. They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to `state` but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.

```react
connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)

```





### Extract Local State into Redux

Now that Redux is connected, you need to extract the state management out of the `Presentational` component and into Redux.



```react
// dispatches submitNewMessage() from this.props, and pass in the current message input from local state as an argument.
 this.props.submitNewMessage(this.state.input);
```



### Finally

```react
/*
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

import rootReducer from './redux/reducers'
import App from './components/App'

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App/>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
*/

```
